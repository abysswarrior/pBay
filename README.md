# Requirements

```markdown
- python version > 3.8
- docker
```

# Run Locally

**Step 1 :** create a new virtualenv and install requirements.

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 2 :** rename `.env.example` to `.env`

```shell
$ mv .env.example .env
```

**Step 2 :** to use OTP code verification create an account in [kavenegar](https://kavenegar.com/) and 
put your API Key in `.env`.

> you need some KYC verification to use API completely

```dotenv
KAVENEGAR_OTP_SECRET="put your secret here"
```

**Step 2 :** if you want to store your media files in object storages (like aws, ...) set `USE_ARVAN_BUCKET` in 
environment file to `True` and set other secret keys.

> for this project i used [Arvan Cloud](https://www.arvancloud.ir/en/products/cloud-storage) object storage called bucket.
> since it uses `boto3` you can use any other object storage you want without any changes.

```dotenv
USE_ARVAN_BUCKET="True"
```

```dotenv
ARVAN_ACCESS_KEY_ID='put your keys here'
ARVAN_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='put your keys here'
ARVAN_ENDPOINT_URL='put your keys here'
ARVAN_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME='put your keys here'
```
**Step 2 :** go to `docker_compose_files` directory and run `Redis` and `RabbitMQ` containers.

```shell
$ docker compose up -d
```

**Step 2 :** run `celery` and `celery beat`.

```shell
$ celery -A config worker -l info
$ celery -A config beat -l INFO --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```

**Step 3 :** run django and reach whole project in [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

```shell
$ python manage.py runserver
```

> you can use `db.sqlite3` DB that is in this project. if you use it, the user and pass for admin test user
> is `admin` and `12345`. some product are available within it.
